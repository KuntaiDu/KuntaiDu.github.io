summerizes some techniques that are extremely useful (I also applies some of them in my slides).

Here is a non-joke for amateur presenters but is a joke for good presenters: one day, a presenter needs to give a 10-minute presentation on an acedemic conference. "Isn't that simple?", he thinks, "I just need to read the introduction part of my paper!"

The fact that makes this joke fun is that: the cognitive processes while listenting to talks and reading research papers are **extremely different**. While reading papers, people have the right to examine the text in a thorough way.

## Give people a reason to care

## It's not about completeness

## When they read, they won't listen

Here, the "read" refers to ANY new contents. Like a new figure, a new line of text, and so on. While people are reading, it is very likely that they will not listen.

## Good talk for acedemic conference has dual purposes
